##Once upon a time…

…there was a girl named Mary that loved chatting through messenger with her friends and she raved about videos on the web. Once upon a time there was a boy named Andrew that breath multimedia games and directed short movies. Both spent too much He was stuck to his laptop for too long. In fact, he would easily lose track of time.

t know that time spent with family, doing other activities and studying was vital to his own happy ending story. 

we live in a world full of technology triggers, causing anxiety, competition, stress… This world we live in steals time from each grown-up and child to be physically and emotionally more connected.

Through Yoga&Stories I am aiming at providing kids and families more quality time, more happy and fun moments!

##I love stories! 

Sharing a good story makes my day. 
As well as reading out for both children and grown-ups 
And we live happily ever after until the next story.
