##What happens in a Kids Yoga class?
- There is a combination of stories, music, games and poses, balancing spontaneity and structure.
- Children develop in a multi-sensorial environment, learning by watching and listening, moving and interacting. 

##What is Family Yoga?
- It is a wonderful opportunity to share yoga practice, reinforcing the physical and emotional connection in a fun way.
- A family session gathers a grown-up (mum, dad, granny, cousin, godmother...) and a child (from the age of 3 years). Together they will make a journey of co-creation and cooperation, always respecting each other’s rhythm.
- Massage, games, dances, poses, breathing and relaxation are all part of a memorable and super-fun story to the body and mind.
