As a little girl I said I wanted to become an air hostess when I grew up. I became a journalist for an interior design magazine, MÃ¡xima Interiores. I wrote about houses and their inhabitants. I am a professional storyteller and I never renounced to my dream of flying. I travel everytime I share a book, a story or a yoga session with kids and grown-ups. I am certified by [Rainbow Kids Yoga](http://rainbowkidsyoga.net) to teach yoga to kids and families. I feel that everyone ends up happier and smiling more after a Yoga&Stories experience.
